two different data type comparison
console.log("2" > 1)
console.log(""02 > 1)


console.log(null > 0) 
console.log(null == 0)
console.log(null >= 0)

The reason is that an equality check == and comparison > < >= <= work deifferently
Cpmparison converts mull to a number treating it as 0
that's why (3) null >= 0 is true and (1) nul > 0 is false


JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, 
meaning that type checking happens at runtime, rather than during compilation

functions is also a non primitive datatype
const myfunc = function()
{
    console.log("Hello")
}

typeof BigInt is undefined
typeof null is object

const mySym = Symbol("hello");
object symbol
